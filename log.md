### R1D4: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I am watching CS50's week5's lecture. As this does not count as coding, I am in paralell continuing my studies in freecodecamp, and just finished the Twitch challenge. 

**Thoughts:** I hope I do not get brain damage from learning too many things in paralell!

### R1D3: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished CS50's pset4. It was easier than I thought! Looking forward to move forward to week 5.

**Thoughts:** Time flies when you get into the "coding-zone"!

### R1D2: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still trying out the resize challenge in CS50's pset4. Getting weird results, but I feel I am almost there! 

**Thoughts:** How easy it is to forget what we learned if we do not practice...

### R1D1: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the whodunit C program for CS50's pset4 and started with the next challenge: resizing a bmp in C

**Thoughts:** How easy it is to forget what we learned if we do not practice...

### R1D0: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Relearned a bit about pointers in C to try an tackle the whodunit problem in pset 4 of CS50's edX course. Went through the problem files and learned about how bitmap files are stored in memory, byte by byte.

**Thoughts:** CS50's is a wonderful course, but it really gets hard by week 4. So much so I stopped back then, but it feels good to restart it and commit to it.
