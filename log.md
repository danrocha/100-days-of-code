# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### R1D20: January 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Half in Python for CS50's pset6, half in Swift following along my study books. 

### R1D19: January 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: A recurring app idea and a Medium article made me deviate from my CS50 course and dive head first into Swift and iOS11 programming. I have [this](https://designcode.io/) and [this](https://www.amazon.de/iOS-11-Programming-Fundamentals-Swift-ebook/dp/B076TQSMY5/ref=pd_sim_351_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=5AN1STMC1Q60GVEB95K8) to guide me. Wish me luck.

**Thoughts**: First C, then Javascript, back to C, then Python, now Swift. My brain is heating up!


### R1D18: January 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Getting deeper into Python, by porting some older C exercises. Really easy and cool language.

**Thoughts**: Muscle memory, gotta get rid of some old C customs!

### R1D17: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started pset6 on CS50! Relieved to get out of C and into Python.  

### R1D16: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time watching CS50's lectures 5,6 and 7, ready now for pset6! Python!  

### R1D15: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Thought I would not have time to code today, but here I am. Finished CS50's pset5! 

### R1D14: January 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: My spell checker is working! Still need to finish implementing the other functions in the pset and clean up everything, but it finally "clicked" and it became all so clear.

### R1D13: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got my tries to work! But it is still a bit blurry how things are working in the background.

**Thoughts**: I feel the "click" coming...

### R1D12: January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Ugh, having a hard type of data structures in C, in particular with tries! Need a night's sleep to figure this out.

### R1D11: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Back to CS50, after having watched Week 5's lecture. Trying to code a spellchecker in C!

### R1D10: January 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Re-learned git and started #Javascript30.

### R1D9: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished freeCodeCamp's Intermediate Algorithm Scripting! Ready for bigger challenges.

### R1D8: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked late today and almost skipped my code hour. But didn't: completed one more challenge in freeCodeCamp and watched a bit of the CS50's week5 lecture.

**Thoughts:** overtime at work is an added challenge to this challenge!

### R1D7: January 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Three more challenges solved in freeCodeCamp's Intermediate Algorithm Scripting. A bit slower as the challenges get harder!

### R1D6: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Five more challenges solved in freeCodeCamp's Intermediate Algorithm Scripting.

### R1D5: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Two more challenges solved in freeCodeCamp's Intermediate Algorithm Scripting. So much fun.

**Thoughts:** freeCodeCamp is such a cool platform!

### R1D4: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I am watching CS50's week5's lecture. As this does not count as coding, I am in paralell continuing my studies in freecodecamp, and just finished the Twitch challenge. 

**Thoughts:** I hope I do not get brain damage from learning too many things in paralell!

### R1D3: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished CS50's pset4. It was easier than I thought! Looking forward to move forward to week 5.

**Thoughts:** Time flies when you get into the "coding-zone"!

### R1D2: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still trying out the resize challenge in CS50's pset4. Getting weird results, but I feel I am almost there! 

**Thoughts:** How easy it is to forget what we learned if we do not practice...

### R1D1: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the whodunit C program for CS50's pset4 and started with the next challenge: resizing a bmp in C

**Thoughts:** How easy it is to forget what we learned if we do not practice...

### R1D0: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Relearned a bit about pointers in C to try an tackle the whodunit problem in pset 4 of CS50's edX course. Went through the problem files and learned about how bitmap files are stored in memory, byte by byte.

**Thoughts:** CS50's is a wonderful course, but it really gets hard by week 4. So much so I stopped back then, but it feels good to restart it and commit to it.
