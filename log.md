# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D33-37: February 12-16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent the past 4 days learning Flask via Miguel's tutorial, then started adapting it to my Move Awards idea! It is so much fun and I am coding more than 2h every day! 

**Thoughts**: I gotta come back to updating here daily!!

### R1D32: February 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got Flask working and really happy people like Miguel Grinberg publish amazing tutorials like [this](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

**Thoughts**: I love how CS50's is aligning with my little Movie app idea!! Flask, Python, Databases and all that.

### R1D31: February 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got into another sinkhole trying to setup Flask in my Linode. 

### R1D30: February 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Yes! Solved. And yes, it was a stupid mistake. Not ready to finally start programming the "admin" interface of my little app project! Can't wait to get started.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes I can get dragged into a sinkhole and waste so much time. But the outcome is always good.

### R1D29: February 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Another head-banging day, still not solved my whole Postgres, pgAdmin problems. 

### R1D28: February 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent 2 hours tryign to figure out how to connect Postgresql with pgAdmin on Mac via SSH. So frustrating and such a waste of time!

### R1D27: February 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: A discussiona t DEV.to made me realize I might be convoluted with my decision to go Firebase. Looking at MySQL now, while still learnign how to code with Swift and Xcode.

### R1D26: February 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Slow day at work, started to look into Firebase as a database for my movie app.

### R1D25: February 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent my hour doing some Swift learning over at Udemy.

### R1D24: February 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Two new things learned today while trying out CS50's pset6: decorator functions and "memoization" in Python.

**Thoughts**: Still trying to wrap my head around it, but I see so much potential. Recursion is also not 100% clear, I guess I'll learn as I go...

### R1D23: February 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did a little Swift programming in the Udemy course I am following, long with some reading on the Swift book; also started the second half of CS50's pset6.

**Thoughts**: I realized I really need a crash course on Recursion, as the application is still not 100% clear to me. 

### R1D22: February 01, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had to skip the day! No free time from waking up to bedtime! Will continue tomorrow! 

### R1D21: January 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finshed the first half of pset6, and read a lot of Swift after that. 

### R1D20: January 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Half in Python for CS50's pset6, half in Swift following along my study books. 

### R1D19: January 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: A recurring app idea and a Medium article made me deviate from my CS50 course and dive head first into Swift and iOS11 programming. I have [this](https://designcode.io/) and [this](https://www.amazon.de/iOS-11-Programming-Fundamentals-Swift-ebook/dp/B076TQSMY5/ref=pd_sim_351_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=5AN1STMC1Q60GVEB95K8) to guide me. Wish me luck.

**Thoughts**: First C, then Javascript, back to C, then Python, now Swift. My brain is heating up!


### R1D18: January 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Getting deeper into Python, by porting some older C exercises. Really easy and cool language.

**Thoughts**: Muscle memory, gotta get rid of some old C customs!

### R1D17: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started pset6 on CS50! Relieved to get out of C and into Python.  

### R1D16: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time watching CS50's lectures 5,6 and 7, ready now for pset6! Python!  

### R1D15: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Thought I would not have time to code today, but here I am. Finished CS50's pset5! 

### R1D14: January 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: My spell checker is working! Still need to finish implementing the other functions in the pset and clean up everything, but it finally "clicked" and it became all so clear.

### R1D13: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got my tries to work! But it is still a bit blurry how things are working in the background.

**Thoughts**: I feel the "click" coming...

### R1D12: January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Ugh, having a hard type of data structures in C, in particular with tries! Need a night's sleep to figure this out.

### R1D11: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Back to CS50, after having watched Week 5's lecture. Trying to code a spellchecker in C!

### R1D10: January 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Re-learned git and started #Javascript30.

### R1D9: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished freeCodeCamp's Intermediate Algorithm Scripting! Ready for bigger challenges.

### R1D8: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked late today and almost skipped my code hour. But didn't: completed one more challenge in freeCodeCamp and watched a bit of the CS50's week5 lecture.

**Thoughts:** overtime at work is an added challenge to this challenge!

### R1D7: January 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Three more challenges solved in freeCodeCamp's Intermediate Algorithm Scripting. A bit slower as the challenges get harder!

### R1D6: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Five more challenges solved in freeCodeCamp's Intermediate Algorithm Scripting.

### R1D5: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Two more challenges solved in freeCodeCamp's Intermediate Algorithm Scripting. So much fun.

**Thoughts:** freeCodeCamp is such a cool platform!

### R1D4: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I am watching CS50's week5's lecture. As this does not count as coding, I am in paralell continuing my studies in freecodecamp, and just finished the Twitch challenge. 

**Thoughts:** I hope I do not get brain damage from learning too many things in paralell!

### R1D3: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished CS50's pset4. It was easier than I thought! Looking forward to move forward to week 5.

**Thoughts:** Time flies when you get into the "coding-zone"!

### R1D2: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still trying out the resize challenge in CS50's pset4. Getting weird results, but I feel I am almost there! 

**Thoughts:** How easy it is to forget what we learned if we do not practice...

### R1D1: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the whodunit C program for CS50's pset4 and started with the next challenge: resizing a bmp in C

**Thoughts:** How easy it is to forget what we learned if we do not practice...

### R1D0: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Relearned a bit about pointers in C to try an tackle the whodunit problem in pset 4 of CS50's edX course. Went through the problem files and learned about how bitmap files are stored in memory, byte by byte.

**Thoughts:** CS50's is a wonderful course, but it really gets hard by week 4. So much so I stopped back then, but it feels good to restart it and commit to it.
