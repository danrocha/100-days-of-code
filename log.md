# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D0: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Relearned a bit about pointers in C to try an tackle the whodunit problem in pset 4 of CS50's edX course. Went through the problem files and learned about how bitmap files are stored in memory, byte by byte.

**Thoughts:** CS50's is a wonderful course, but it really gets hard by week 4. So much so I stopped back then, but it feels good to restart it and commit to it.
