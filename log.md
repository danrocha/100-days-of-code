### R1D2: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still trying out the resize challenge in CS50's pset4. Getting weird results, but I feel I am almost there! 

**Thoughts:** How easy it is to forget what we learned if we do not practice...

### R1D0: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Relearned a bit about pointers in C to try an tackle the whodunit problem in pset 4 of CS50's edX course. Went through the problem files and learned about how bitmap files are stored in memory, byte by byte.

**Thoughts:** CS50's is a wonderful course, but it really gets hard by week 4. So much so I stopped back then, but it feels good to restart it and commit to it.
